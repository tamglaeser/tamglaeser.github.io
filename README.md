# Multilingual Site

This site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) and Sylvain Durand's multilingual Jekyll theme (info [here](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/)). I also use my friend Josh's [post metadata script](https://github.com/jyn514/jyn514.github.io/blob/master/scripts/new_post). Post tags were added based off of [Long Qian's detailed post](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/).

To spin up a local server running these files, type
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
